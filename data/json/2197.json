He was fully clothed and snuggled up in a blanket.  A wallet with a driver's license and other identification was found nearby.  The ID belonged to a Pinellas County, Florida, man who had lost it several months previously.  Apparently, this man was known in the area to be using the name on the ID, and reportedly had been living in the area for several months.  There was evidence of camping at the scene, perhaps even with a companion.  He was reportedly last seen sometime around the middle of December, 1983, in the Cashiers area.
