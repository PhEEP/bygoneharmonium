The body was shot multiple times with a handgun and shotgun to the head and right arm.  The body was discovered following an anonymous call made to the Santa Fe, New Mexico Police Department.  The caller stated he was traveling in the State of Connecticut and smelled an awful odor and observed two legs sticking out of a garbage bag.  Connecticut State Police along with New York State Police searched the areas surrounding the two states and discovered the body in New York.  Fingerprints were taken (only one useable fingerprint was able to be taken) from the deceased with negative results.  The deceased was believed to be male; however, many years later the sex of the deceased was labeled as undetermined.  Photographs of the clothing of the deceased were taken and fliers were handed out in an attempt to identify the body, with negative results.  Missing person and missing children records were searched with negative results.  Area middle and high school principals were notified with negative results.  Dental structures revealed no new information on the possible identity of the body.  Dr. ROH of the Westchester Medical Center advises a DNA sample will be needed to determine the sex of the body.  Negative results to date from NCIC and DCJS-Missing Children's database.","case_hair_color":"Black","case_head_hair":"","case_body_hair":"","case_facial_hair":"","case_eye_color_left":"Unknown or Missing","case_eye_color_right":"Unknown or Missing","case_eye_description":"","fingerprints":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tFingerprint information is available and entered\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t","clothing_accessories":"","case_clothing_on_body":"Shorts: Gray and Blue\nPants: Blue and ray","case_clothing_with_body":"","case_footwear":"Avia Women's Sneakers: Silver and Dark Gray with Blue Laces","case_jewelry":"","case_eyewear":"","case_other_items_with_body":"","dental":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tDental information / charting is currently not available\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t","dna":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tComplete - Insufficient DNA for profiling\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t","images":["/en/medias/thumb/8636","/en/medias/thumb/8637"],"documents":"\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThere are currently no documents available for this case.<br><br><br><br>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t"}
