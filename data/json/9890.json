She paid for a room in cash through 07/11/11. It was later found that she had stayed at other local motels in the area, always taking a taxi, paying in cash, and giving false and different names. She told the Motel 9 that her name was Sandra Nelson, of 5203 Bosa Ave., Park City, UT. This was later found to be a non-existent address and false name. She also stated that she was originally from Los Angeles and was looking for a house in this area. On 07/11/11, she did not show up for breakfast as had been her custom. Since it was her last paid day, staff assumed she had checked out. They entered her room with a master key and found her deceased on the bed with pills at her feet and a bright blue, granular purging coming from her nose and mouth. There was no suicide note but autopsy results showed a massive overdose of multiple medications and case was ruled as a suicide. Luggage and other items were found in the room but all identifiers had been meticulously eliminated before death. All attempts to identify the decedent have failed.","case_hair_color":"Gray or Partially Gray","case_head_hair":"Gray/ black, with more white in front around face; styled into soft waves, but tight, afro curls when wet at autopsy","case_body_hair":"","case_facial_hair":"None","case_eye_color_left":"Brown","case_eye_color_right":"Brown","case_eye_description":"","case_scars_and_marks_details":"checked","case_finger_and_toe_nails_details":"checked","case_physical_other_details":"checked","fingerprints":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tFingerprint information is available and entered\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t","clothing_accessories":"","case_clothing_on_body":"Brown/ black/white  Paisley design pullover top, black undershirt; black bra; black pants; white cotton panties; white socks","case_clothing_with_body":"2 suitcases w/ miscellaneous clothing and toiletries","case_footwear":"Black shoes","case_jewelry":"White metal earrings; white metal chain necklace; white metal wristwatch","case_eyewear":"Black plastic framed Rx eyeglasses","case_other_items_with_body":"Walking cane; unmarked baggies of pills/ medications; black purse w/ wallet but no personal information; Bible; book \"The Political Teachings of Jesus\"","dental":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tDental information / charting is currently not available\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t","dna":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSample submitted - Tests complete\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t","images":["/en/medias/thumb/12819"],"documents":"\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThere are currently no documents available for this case.<br><br><br><br>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t"}
