Pelican Island is located near the confluence of the Mississippi and Missouri Rivers.  This area has been known to yield Native American human remains.  The recovered remains exhibit taphonomic features consistent with being at or near the ground surface for an extended period of time.  The parietal portion exhibits a probable ante/perimortem fracture - because of the observed trauma, the case is viewed as of possible forensic significance.","case_hair_color":"","case_head_hair":"","case_body_hair":"","case_facial_hair":"","case_eye_color_left":"","case_eye_color_right":"","case_eye_description":"","fingerprints":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tFingerprint information is currently not available\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t","clothing_accessories":"","case_clothing_on_body":"","case_clothing_with_body":"","case_footwear":"","case_jewelry":"","case_eyewear":"","case_other_items_with_body":"","dental":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tDental information / charting is currently not available\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t","dna":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tComplete - Insufficient DNA for profiling\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t","images":[],"documents":"\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThere are currently no documents available for this case.<br><br><br><br>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t"}
