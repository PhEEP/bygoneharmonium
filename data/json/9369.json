There is no active investigation related to the remains with a medical examiner, coroner, or law enforcement agency at this time.  The remains were all recovered on 09-09-2011 from the belongings of a pathologist subsequent to his death; however, documentation with the remains indicated that they were originally found on 05-27-1997.  The remains were submitted to the UNTCHI Laboratory of Forensic Anthropology by the Southeast Texas Forensic Center, on behalf of the Jefferson County District Attorney's Office, for anthropological analyses and DNA extraction.  There is a possibility some or all of these remains are related to a boating accident which took place in the Gulf of Mexico off Sabine Pass, Texas.  Entry into NamUs was required UNTCHI analyses and upload to CODIS.","case_hair_color":"Unknown or Completely Bald","case_head_hair":"","case_body_hair":"","case_facial_hair":"","case_eye_color_left":"Unknown or Missing","case_eye_color_right":"Unknown or Missing","case_eye_description":"","fingerprints":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tFingerprint information is currently not available\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t","clothing_accessories":"","case_clothing_on_body":"","case_clothing_with_body":"","case_footwear":"","case_jewelry":"","case_eyewear":"","case_other_items_with_body":"","dental":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tDental information / charting is currently not available\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t","dna":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSample submitted - Tests complete\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t","images":[],"documents":"\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThere are currently no documents available for this case.<br><br><br><br>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t"}
