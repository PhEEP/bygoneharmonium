A .22 semi-automatic pistol was recovered from the scene. Based on clothing recovered, it is believed that the decedent's death took place during the winter time. It was suggested that during the decedent's younger years he was probably around 5'10\" but due to severe arthritis, his stature at the time of his death was around 5'8\". The decedent also had extensive gold bridgework and numerous porcelain facings that would have been very expensive.
