Detectives have learned that the bones discovered April 22 are the remains of a man between the ages of 55 to 70 at the time of death, but have not been able to identify the man. Detectives hope that by releasing the image of the plate, someone may be able to provide information about a missing person who had such a surgery in the late 1980’s or early 1990’s. Detectives believe the remains may have been in the dunes for as much as the past 25 years. The Nueces County Medical Examiner’s Office has not determined a cause of death as of June 25, 2015. Anyone who may know a person who had this type of surgery should call Detectives at 886-2840 to help identify the remains.\n\nA 28-year-old man called Corpus Christi Police on April 22, 2015 after he found some human bones in the dunes  Beach Access Road 4 on Padre Island. The 28-year-old man directed Officers to the bones. The Nueces County Medical Examiner was called and he confirmed that the bones were human and that they had been there for a while.\n\nOfficers continue to work with the Medical Examiner to investigate if any crime has been committed. Detectives understand that some members of the public may want to provide information and stay anonymous which can be accomplished if they call Crime Stoppers at 888-TIPS (8477).","case_hair_color":"Unknown or Completely Bald","case_head_hair":"unknown","case_body_hair":"unknown","case_facial_hair":"unknown","case_eye_color_left":"Unknown or Missing","case_eye_color_right":"Unknown or Missing","case_eye_description":"unknown","case_artificial_body_parts_and_aids_details":"checked","fingerprints":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tFingerprint information is currently not available\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t","clothing_accessories":"","case_clothing_on_body":"unknown","case_clothing_with_body":"unknown","case_footwear":"unknown","case_jewelry":"unknown","case_eyewear":"unknown","case_other_items_with_body":"unknown","dental":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tDental information / charting is available and will be entered later\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t","dna":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSample submitted - Tests complete\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t","images":["/en/medias/thumb/34336"],"documents":"\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThere are currently no documents available for this case.<br><br><br><br>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t"}
