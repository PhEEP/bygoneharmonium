The initial anthropological investigation in 1979 identified the decedent as a female, but more recent analysis (prior to rediscovery of accompanying records) suggest male cranial morphologies. Because of this discrepancy, it might be useful to compare both male and female missing persons. The remains were burned and highly fragmented. Desiccated soft tissue adheres to hands, forearms, and parts of the cranium. Investigators at the time of discovery suggested that burning happened subsequent to desiccation, and ongoing analysis is addressing this further. Various items were found in the crime lab box with the remains, but it is unclear whether or how these items relate to the case.\n\nUPDATE-- Male sex DNA confirmed by University of North Texas (7/6/16)","case_hair_color":"Sandy","case_head_hair":"Light brown/dark blonde hairs located with the remains ","case_body_hair":"","case_facial_hair":"","case_eye_color_left":"Unknown or Missing","case_eye_color_right":"Unknown or Missing","case_eye_description":"","fingerprints":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tFingerprint information is currently not available\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t","clothing_accessories":"","case_clothing_on_body":"","case_clothing_with_body":"white shoelace","case_footwear":"","case_jewelry":"","case_eyewear":"","case_other_items_with_body":"parts of a styrofoam container (resembling a restaurant \"take-out\" box)\n\na house style key\n\nOld, blank form labeled as being from the Marquette Cement Company\n\nsmall, rectangular, rusty metal canister bearing traces of what appears to be an eagle emblem","dental":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tDental information / charting is available and entered\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t","dna":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSample submitted - Tests complete\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t","images":[],"documents":"\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThere are currently no documents available for this case.<br><br><br><br>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t"}
