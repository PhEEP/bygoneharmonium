She sent the bone fragment to a friend in Maine who upon examination believed it to be human.  He sent the bone back and advised her to call law enforcement.  The hiker is a resident of Citrus County so she called the Citrus County Sheriff's Office who then turned the bone fragment over to the Maron County Sheriff's Office.  The bone fragment was brought to the District V Medical Examiner's Office where it was examined and photographed.  The bone fragment was then turned over to CAPHIL.  The skull fragment (calotte) represents a young to mid adult of indeterminate sex and ancestry.  Perimortem fractures may have resulted from a perimortem gunshot wound or perimortem blunt force.","case_hair_color":"Unknown or Completely Bald","case_head_hair":"","case_body_hair":"","case_facial_hair":"","case_eye_color_left":"Unknown or Missing","case_eye_color_right":"Unknown or Missing","case_eye_description":"","fingerprints":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tFingerprint information is currently not available\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t","clothing_accessories":"","case_clothing_on_body":"","case_clothing_with_body":"","case_footwear":"","case_jewelry":"","case_eyewear":"","case_other_items_with_body":"","dental":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tDental information / charting is currently not available\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t","dna":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSample submitted - Tests complete\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t","images":[],"documents":"\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThere are currently no documents available for this case.<br><br><br><br>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t"}
