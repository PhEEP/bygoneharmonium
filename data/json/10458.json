The shoe was reportedly recovered from a rocky area near the boat ramp.  Observed within was a sock containing possible human bones.  The St. Charles County Sheriff’s Department was contacted and responded to the scene.  No additional personal effects or skeletal elements were recovered during the course of their investigation (St. Charles report number 2012-3564).  \n\nThe skeletal remains are in excellent condition and represent the complete LEFT foot of an adult.  Adipocere tissue is present and especially concreted to the calcaneus (heel) and the inferior (bottom) surface of the foot.  Evidence of arthritic changes to include lipping and some degenerative changes are observed at the articulation of the talus and calcaneus.\n\nAll elements present are observed to be fully form and indicative of an adult individual.  The arthritic changes are suggestive of a slightly older age range (e.g. 40+).\n","case_hair_color":"","case_head_hair":" ","case_body_hair":" ","case_facial_hair":" ","case_eye_color_left":"","case_eye_color_right":"","case_eye_description":"","fingerprints":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tFingerprint information is currently not available\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t","clothing_accessories":"","case_clothing_on_body":"","case_clothing_with_body":"","case_footwear":"LEFT brown leather shoe.
