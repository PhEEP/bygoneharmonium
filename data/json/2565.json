Examination by a forensic anthropologist determines that the remains represent at least two persons: a male designated John Doe #02-89 (Coroner case #89-0443), and a female designated Jane Doe #04-89 (Coroner case #89-0444).  A mandible could not be verifiably associated with either, and was designated a separate unidentified remains: Undetermined Doe #01-89 (Coroner case #89-0180).  Thus far no DNA profile (STR or mtDNA) have been able to be obtained from either 89-0443 or 89-0444).  A mitochondrial profile has been developed from the mandible only (no STR).  Dental X-rays will be available for mandible only.
