The fact that is was found by hunters, isolated, separated from the rest of the body, suggests decomposition elsewhere, perhaps in Delaware Bay (depending on currents) and deposited on the shore by waves and wind.  The lack of mineral staining on this skull, usual in skulls under water in a quiet spot, fits this guess. (excerpt from letter to Delaware State Police from Ali Z.
