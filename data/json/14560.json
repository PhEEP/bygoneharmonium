The hands were so badly burned that processing by our lab was impossible at that time.  The hands were severed from the body and forwarded to the Federal Bureau of Investigation Identification Unit for special processing.  \n\nA fingerprint classification was made and is as follows:\n\n17\tL  1  U  III  4.\n          M  1  U  III \n\nIn 1976, the F.B.I. ran this classification through its criminal records file, and its military and civilian file with negative results.  Although a forensic odontological report was not made, it was noted that the victim had the following dental characteristics:\n•\tOld fracture of left mandible.\n•\t1st Molar, upper left, rotted off at gum.\n•\tLower right bicuspid grown crooked in toward toungue.\nAn autopsy was performed on the body and no evidence of shooting or cutting was indicated.  X-ray examination did show the subject had an old, healed fracture of the left “mandudiable” (perhaps mandible).  It appeared the subject had never received any dental work.\n\nDescription is as follows: Fingerprint classification is listed above:\n•\tRace: White\n•\tSex: Male\n•\tAge: 18-22\n•\tHeight: 5’ 7”\n•\tWeight: 140-150 lbs.\n•\tShoe Size: 7 ½ E (actual) – Probable Size Worn: 8 D\n•\tEyes: unknown\n•\tHair: Light Brown with reddish tint\n•\tTeeth: #14 1st molar upper left rotted at gum, #28 1st lower right bicuspid crooked, grown in toward tongue\n•\tBlood Type: A negative\n•\tNo tattoos or surgical scars\n•\tNo jewelry or identification on body\n•\tClothing: Appears to have been Western style from remains that were not burned and were adhering to the body.\n","case_hair_color":"Red/Auburn","case_head_hair":"Full Head of Hair.\nFrom Autopsy Report: \"Examination of hair reveals it to be brown in color with red appearance to ends, which appear to be changed secondary to heat.\"","case_body_hair":"\"The hair within the axilla has a brownish to auburn appearance.\"\n\"Pubic hair appears auburn in coloration.\"","case_facial_hair":"mustache","case_eye_color_left":"Unknown or Missing","case_eye_color_right":"Unknown or Missing","case_eye_description":"Eye color was either not documented, or burnt beyond recognition.","case_physical_other_details":"checked","fingerprints":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tFingerprint information is available and entered\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t","clothing_accessories":"","case_clothing_on_body":"He was wearing a blue fish net body shirt, white cotton western style shirt with snap buttons, and light blue cotton denim jeans.
