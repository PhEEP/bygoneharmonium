His jacket bore a patch from the Soil Conservation Service of the U.S. Dept. of Agriculture. The name of the agency was changed to the Natural Resources Conservation Serivce in 1994, but they still use the same logo that’s on his patch. Also, his hat is from an outfit out of Sedona, AZ that does ropes training for wilderness rescue (http://www.ropesthatrescue.com/). It looks like a relatively small business, and they don’t seem to sell their logo gear online—the only folks on their website wearing the hats are their staff—OD water bottle, shampoo bottle, left shoe, red sleeping bag, nasal solution bottle, red long sleeve shirt, deodorant, sunglasses, compact mirror, green plaid jacket, sock, blue underwear, tan ball cap, shorts with belt, solar light, water jug, Chapstick, green jacket, canvas bag with contents socks, grey t-shirt, black garbage bag, green cup, sock, nylon bag, sunglasses, belt, and shoelaces","dental":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tDental information / charting is available and entered\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t","dna":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSample submitted - Tests complete\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t","images":[],"documents":"\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t1 documents available for this case.\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t"}
