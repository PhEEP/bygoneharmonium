The decedent was possibly a transient.  He was described as being in his mid 50s and early 70s, stood 5â€™6â€ (66â€), with graying dark-brown or black hair.  He had male-pattern baldness.  He was probably of average weight.  He was missing most of his teeth through natural processes, and there were no dental restorations in the teeth that remained.  He had sustained a lower jaw fracture years prior, which had never been treated.  Identity may only be established by dental X-rays (on file and see attached) and DNA (refer to CODIS #BK-08-001011).  Possible comparison with \"smiling photographs\" (showing teeth).
