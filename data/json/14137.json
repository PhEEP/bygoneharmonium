The decedent was initially identified as ARTURO DE LA GARZA-TORRES DOB 04/26/1966 by fingerprint comparison by the Hidalgo County Sheriff’s Office with fingerprints on file from prior detainment records with the U.S. Border Patrol; however, the Mexican consulate was unable to confirm the individual ever lived in Tamaulipas, Mexico and could not locate the decedent’s family listed on the prior detainment records.  The Hidalgo County Sheriff’s Office also found no evidence he lived at the residences he listed on the prior detainment records.  Therefore, the autopsy report and death certificate will be filed with the State of Texas as: John Doe 2 AKA Arturo de la Garza-Torres DOB 04/26/1966, since his identity cannot be verified.  A DNA blood stain card will be sent to the University of North Texas Center of Human Identification for DNA analysis and upload into CODIS.  The name Arturo de la Garza-Torres is also uploaded on the Unclaimed data base for NAMUS. \n","case_hair_color":"Black","case_head_hair":"( black and gray) 3/4 inch","case_body_hair":"none","case_facial_hair":"none","case_eye_color_left":"Brown","case_eye_color_right":"Brown","case_eye_description":"","case_amputations_details":"checked","fingerprints":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tFingerprint information is available elsewhere\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t","clothing_accessories":"","case_clothing_on_body":"green briefs and black with red socks","case_clothing_with_body":"none","case_footwear":"none","case_jewelry":"none","case_eyewear":"none","case_other_items_with_body":"none","dental":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tDental information / charting is available and entered\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t","dna":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSample submitted - Tests complete\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t","images":[],"documents":"\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThere are currently no documents available for this case.<br><br><br><br>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t"}
