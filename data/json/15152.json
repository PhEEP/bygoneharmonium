A Siberian Husky discovered the infant's frozen body and carried her to its owner's home, less than a quarter of a mile away. The infant's umbilical cord was still attached. \n\nInvestigators established that the baby was born at the gravel pit on an access road near the intersection of Route 1 and Pelletier Avenue. The baby was abandoned in temperatures that fell to 30 degrees below zero. Experts state that she could not have lived longer than 30 minutes in such temperatures. Based upon tire tracks found at the scene, investigators believe the car was small. They do not know if the mother drove herself or was driven but boot prints were found in the snow with blood. Investigators suspect that the mother may be Canadian. \n","case_hair_color":"","case_head_hair":"","case_body_hair":"","case_facial_hair":"","case_eye_color_left":"","case_eye_color_right":"","case_eye_description":"","fingerprints":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tFingerprint information is currently not available\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t","clothing_accessories":"","case_clothing_on_body":"","case_clothing_with_body":"","case_footwear":"","case_jewelry":"","case_eyewear":"","case_other_items_with_body":"","dental":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tDental information / charting is currently not available\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t","dna":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSample available - Not yet submitted\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t","images":[],"documents":"\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThere are currently no documents available for this case.<br><br><br><br>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t"}
