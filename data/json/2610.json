The remains were mummified/partially skeletonized, with extensive animal activity.  He is likely a White male, 50 to 60 years of age, and 70â€ to 72â€ in height, robust.  Investigation reveals that identity is likely that of a missing Texas man, James Beverlin (DNA on file).  Identity may only be established by comparison of head X-rays (or possibly other body X-rays) or DNA.  The body was exhumed for DNA sampling 05/29/09 (refer to CA DOJ tracking #BK-08-000853). To day only a 3 locus STR has been developed.","case_hair_color":"Gray or Partially Gray","case_head_hair":"Gray or Partially Gray","case_body_hair":"","case_facial_hair":"","case_eye_color_left":"Unknown or Missing","case_eye_color_right":"Unknown or Missing","case_eye_description":"Unknown","fingerprints":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tFingerprint information is currently not available\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t","clothing_accessories":"","case_clothing_on_body":"","case_clothing_with_body":"","case_footwear":"","case_jewelry":"","case_eyewear":"","case_other_items_with_body":"","dental":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tDental information / charting is available and entered\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t","dna":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSample submitted - Tests complete\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t","images":[],"documents":"\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThere are currently no documents available for this case.<br><br><br><br>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t"}
