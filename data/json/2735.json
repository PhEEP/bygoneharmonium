The remains are observed laid out on a rocky shoal or rip rap, which extends approximately five feet above the water level of Lake Michigan. This riprap surrounds the entire perimeter of the base of Navy Pier, where the pier foundation meets the waterline of Lake Michigan, and protrudes outward into the water approximately twenty feet before it submerges below the water line.  \nThe remains are observed prone on its back, with feet pointed in a southwest direction and the upper torso pointed in a northeast direction. It is clad in a heavy dark colored zippered sweatshirt, black, possibly denim pants, which were worn over red sweat pants. Tan colored work boots are observed with dark brown laces. The shoes and clothing appear to be in relatively good condition. A paging device is observed clipped to the left side of the pants on the waistband.\n\nThere is a skull, which has become disarticulated from the torso of the remains and it is observed face down, near the shoulders. The lower jaw containing teeth has become unhinged from the skull, which also contains teeth. It appears to be completely skeletonized.\n\nThe middle torso area of the remains is exposed and the rib cage is visible, as is the spinal column. Very little soft tissue is observed or present, and no internal organs are observed.
