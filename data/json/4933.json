The body was located just East of the Washington Street Bridge in the city of Spokane Washington. The body was partially skeletonized and unrecognizable. The anthropology exam indicates possibly Caucasian with possible African (Black) mixture. By Anthropology exam an estimated age of 33-55 years with an age emphasis toward age 40. The autopsy indicates an age range of 33-42 but not over age 50. The scalp hair is suggestive of African American or possible mixed race. The anthropology exam suggests that the jaw, nose, and left orbital ridge trauma probably occurred during a single traumatic injury. The body could weigh 120-150 pounds and could be slightly taller than the measured height of 64.5 inches. This man would have had obvious facial deformities secondary to a traumatic injury or injuries.","case_hair_color":"Black","case_head_hair":"consistent with negroid hair,   3/4 inch from roots to the ends.
