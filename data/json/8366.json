This man had arrived in Parker on Saturday, February 1st.  He reportedly had traveled by bus from Riverside, CA, to Blythe, and then to Parker.  He was attempting to get bus passage to Las Vegas.  He carried a suitcase with various items for sale (pills, bottle openers, razor blades) and may have been a traveling salesman.  He was described as being a White male, about 60 years of age, approximately 6 feet in height and 180 lbs.  He had false teeth and wore glasses (which he wore on the tip of his nose).  He had a broad face, talked and walked slowly.  He may have given his name as \"W.C. Laugtz\"  (same document notes : \"A.A. Seattery\") and stated he last lived in Denver, Colorado.  He claimed that he wrote articles about his travels, which were published in the Salt Lake Tribune, Salt Lake City (denied by city editor).  He also claimed to have been a Railroad Station Agent (Boston-Main Railroad, 1929?) at one time in North Hampton, Massachusetts.  He stated that he was a member of the Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen.  No photographs, fingerprints, or dental records were obtained.
