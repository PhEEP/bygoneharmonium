The skull is that of a juvenile, probably between 8 and 16 years of age.  The maxilla (upper jaw) was missing and no mandible or post-cranial remains were ever found.  Sex, race, stature, weight, cannot be determined.  Identity can only be established using head X-rays or DNA.  Samples were submitted to CA DOJ-MPDP (Reference #BK-02-000450), but no nucDNA profile could be developed, only mtDNA.  Therefore missing person comparison samples must be submitted from the maternal side of the family as well.
