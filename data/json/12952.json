Lauderdale (Lauderdale-By-the-Sea was where we stayed) for winter vacations.  One year, it was probably around 1959, I found a human jaw bone washed up on the beach with a single molar tooth still intact.  I brought it home, showed it to my dentist to confirm that it was a human bone, and kept it in my room for some years and then lost track of it.  My wife and I recently sold our home of 35 years and moved to a condo.  In the process, I found a box of things from my childhood and the jaw bone was in it.\n\nIt occurred to me after watching a documentary recently about solutions to cold cases, that maybe you would have an interest in me sending this item to you.  In jest, I said to my wife, 'This could be Jimmy Hoffa's jaw bone!'  If there is no interest on your part, I will probably just give it a proper burial.\"  **end of email**\n\n","case_hair_color":"","case_head_hair":"","case_body_hair":"","case_facial_hair":"","case_eye_color_left":"","case_eye_color_right":"","case_eye_description":"","fingerprints":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tFingerprint information is currently not available\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t","clothing_accessories":"","case_clothing_on_body":"","case_clothing_with_body":"","case_footwear":"","case_jewelry":"","case_eyewear":"","case_other_items_with_body":"","dental":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tDental information / charting is currently not available\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t","dna":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSample available - Not yet submitted\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t","images":[],"documents":"\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThere are currently no documents available for this case.<br><br><br><br>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t"}
