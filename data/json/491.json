It is not known how this man may have come to be in the river. The cause and Manner of death are both undetermined. The body was in an advanced state of decomposition. There was a skull fracture and other bodily injuries which were highly suspiscious for homicide and very possible to have occurred prior to the body entering into the water. This man had a possible tattoo \"RICH\" the R, C, and H were faily clear and possibly looked as if the letter \"I\" was present between the \"R\" and \"C\" as well but not definitively. The tattoo was not professional and was located on the left lateral bicep region.  Samples were submitted by our office in 2008 to the FBI Laboratory for DNA profile. A partial DNA sequence was obtained but not enough of a profile to be uploaded into a database by them. A previous submission of 2 teeth to the FBI Lab in 2004 for DNA did not yield a result.","case_hair_color":"Unknown or Completely Bald","case_head_hair":"unknown","case_body_hair":"","case_facial_hair":"","case_eye_color_left":"Unknown or Missing","case_eye_color_right":"Unknown or Missing","case_eye_description":"unknown","case_tattoos_details":"checked","fingerprints":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tFingerprint information is currently not available\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t","clothing_accessories":"","case_clothing_on_body":"1 pair of dark colored Hi-Tec brand boots size 7. 1 pair of bluish socks with white trim.
