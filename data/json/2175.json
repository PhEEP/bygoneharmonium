The child is estimated to be 2-4 years old with brown, wavy hair. The child had an overbite that might have been noticeable to others. This child was found with another young, Caucasian girl, 1-3 years old that also remains unidentified (NamUs #2176). DNA has confirmed that this younger girl (NamUs #2176) is maternally related to two additional unidentified females that were found in 1985 in another barrel in the same wooded area of Allenstown (NamUs #2174 & 2173). It is unclear how this child is associated with the three related females but itâ€™s estimated that they all died at the same time between 1978-1984. Advanced forensic testing reveals that this non-related child did not grow up in the same geographic area as other three victims. She likely was born and spent the majority of her childhood in a more northern and inland location such as northern New Hampshire, northern Vermont, upstate New York and further inland.","case_hair_color":"Brown","case_head_hair":"Slightly wavy, light brown hair, approximately 5 inches long","case_body_hair":"","case_facial_hair":"","case_eye_color_left":"Unknown or Missing","case_eye_color_right":"Unknown or Missing","case_eye_description":"Decomposition precluded assessment of eye color","fingerprints":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tFingerprint information is currently not available\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t","clothing_accessories":"","case_clothing_on_body":"","case_clothing_with_body":"","case_footwear":"","case_jewelry":"","case_eyewear":"","case_other_items_with_body":"","dental":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tDental information / charting is available and entered\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t","dna":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSample submitted - Tests complete\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t","images":["/en/medias/thumb/21303","/en/medias/thumb/21304","/en/medias/thumb/33484"],"documents":"\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThere are currently no documents available for this case.<br><br><br><br>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t"}
