On May 9, 2000 the skeletal remains of two additional female children were recovered. The adult female was between 23-33 years old. The three children were young, all under 11 years old. DNA testing confirmed that two of the children were maternally related to the adult female. All four victims may be biologically linked, but DNA results are still pending. It is estimated that they died in the early 1980â€™s. See NamUs profiles 2173, 2175, and 2176 for detailed information on the other victims related to this adult.","case_hair_color":"Brown","case_head_hair":"Light brown, wavy hair approximately 4 inched in length","case_body_hair":"","case_facial_hair":"","case_eye_color_left":"Unknown or Missing","case_eye_color_right":"Unknown or Missing","case_eye_description":"Unknown, skeletal remains","fingerprints":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tFingerprint information is currently not available\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t","clothing_accessories":"","case_clothing_on_body":"","case_clothing_with_body":"","case_footwear":"","case_jewelry":"","case_eyewear":"","case_other_items_with_body":"","dental":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tDental information / charting is available and entered\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t","dna":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSample submitted - Tests complete\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t","images":["/en/medias/thumb/1328","/en/medias/thumb/21307","/en/medias/thumb/34288"],"documents":"\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThere are currently no documents available for this case.<br><br><br><br>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t"}
