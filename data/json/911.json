Only recently has she determined that the skull may be of forensic interest.  She reported that the skull was probably of forensic interest on July 24, 2007.  The skull is missing facial bones, including maxilla and mandible, and is that of a male adult, most likely White or Hispanic (not Black or Native American), and was probably buried at some point.  There is a bullet hole to the top of the skull and a large defect at the base.  No STR or mtDNA profile could be developed by CA DOJ-DNA/CODIS reference #BK-07-000722).  Identity may only be confirmed by head X-rays.","case_hair_color":"Unknown or Completely Bald","case_head_hair":"Unknown","case_body_hair":"","case_facial_hair":"","case_eye_color_left":"Unknown or Missing","case_eye_color_right":"Unknown or Missing","case_eye_description":"","fingerprints":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tFingerprint information is currently not available\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t","clothing_accessories":"","case_clothing_on_body":"","case_clothing_with_body":"","case_footwear":"","case_jewelry":"","case_eyewear":"","case_other_items_with_body":"","dental":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tDental information / charting is currently not available\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t","dna":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tComplete - Insufficient DNA for profiling\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t","images":[],"documents":"\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThere are currently no documents available for this case.<br><br><br><br>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t"}
