Testing was expected to take at least a week, Deputy Coroner Dottie Lindsay said. An initial inspection did not reveal any obvious signs of trauma. \n\nA Mount Pleasant couple and their two sons, ages 10 and 11, were in their small boat when the husband spotted a black object on the shoreline around 2 p.m., according to a police report. At first he thought it was an anchor. \n\nAfter calling 911, the husband scooped up the skull with a life preserver and moved it farther up the bank so the rising tide would not carry it away, the report states. The family met Mount Pleasant police officers at Remley's Point boat landing and took them back to the spot. \n\n\n","case_hair_color":"Unknown or Completely Bald","case_head_hair":"no hair recovered","case_body_hair":"","case_facial_hair":"","case_eye_color_left":"Unknown or Missing","case_eye_color_right":"Unknown or Missing","case_eye_description":"no soft tissue recovered","fingerprints":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tFingerprint information is currently not available\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t","clothing_accessories":"","case_clothing_on_body":"","case_clothing_with_body":"","case_footwear":"","case_jewelry":"","case_eyewear":"","case_other_items_with_body":"","dental":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tDental information / charting is available and entered\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t","dna":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSample submitted - Tests complete\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t","images":["/en/medias/thumb/8474"],"documents":"\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThere are currently no documents available for this case.<br><br><br><br>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t"}
