Human skull discovered in a wooden basket beneath a wooden staircase in the garage of a home at 141 Main Street, Townsend, DE by a women who entered the garage looking for her missing cat. \n\nThese remains represent a 35 to 70 year old male of either Native American or Anglocaucasian\n(non-Mestizo) ancestry and unknown stature.\n\nThe general impression is that this material represents a “found object” that had previously been\nburied. Although likely of early historical origins (slight reaction to 3M HCl; slight florescence\nof cortex in cross section), forensic significance cannot be ruled out.\n\nNote:  Law Enforcement officers, Medical Examiners and Coroners system user please refer to \"circumstances\" in police section for details.\n","case_hair_color":"Unknown or Completely Bald","case_head_hair":"Hair not recovered.","case_body_hair":"","case_facial_hair":"","case_eye_color_left":"Unknown or Missing","case_eye_color_right":"Unknown or Missing","case_eye_description":"Decomposition (skull only) precluded assessment of eye color.","fingerprints":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tFingerprint information is currently not available\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t","clothing_accessories":"","case_clothing_on_body":"","case_clothing_with_body":"","case_footwear":"","case_jewelry":"","case_eyewear":"","case_other_items_with_body":"","dental":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tDental information / charting is available and entered\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t","dna":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSample submitted - Tests complete\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t","images":["/en/medias/thumb/3328","/en/medias/thumb/3329","/en/medias/thumb/3330","/en/medias/thumb/3331","/en/medias/thumb/3332","/en/medias/thumb/3333","/en/medias/thumb/3334","/en/medias/thumb/3336","/en/medias/thumb/3337","/en/medias/thumb/3338","/en/medias/thumb/3339","/en/medias/thumb/3340","/en/medias/thumb/3341","/en/medias/thumb/3342","/en/medias/thumb/3343","/en/medias/thumb/3344","/en/medias/thumb/3345"],"documents":"\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThere are currently no documents available for this case.<br><br><br><br>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t"}
