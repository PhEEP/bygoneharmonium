He observed a vehicle traveling westbound with very dim lheadlights and attempted to make a traffic stop. The Deputy noted that the driver was the sole occupant of the vehicle. The subject then exited the highway on County Highway G. As he reached the intersection of the exit ramp and Golf Road, the driver sped up and ran through a stop sign at the westbound exit ramp of the County Highway SS exit ramp. As the Deputy approached the intersection, he observed the vehicle go off the roadway and lost sight of the vehicle temporarily due to heavy fog. The Deputy exited his vehicle, searched for the driver in the wooded area, and discovered the vehicle upside down. The driver had been ejected and was found approximately 25 feet away from the vehicle. Later investigation revealed that the vehicle had been stolen from Gurnee, Illinois.","case_hair_color":"Brown","case_head_hair":"The hair is short and cut in a military style ","case_body_hair":"A moderate amount of hair is present on the chest.
