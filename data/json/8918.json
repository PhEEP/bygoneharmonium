He gave the hair to police the same day.   On July 11, 2011 a lifeguard located a small amount of human hair and other accessories while walking along the beach in front of Ocean Village, Bethany Beach. He turned over the hair and other accessories to the police.  Another fisherman also caught quantity of hair in ocean while surf casting from beach north of Fenwick Island, DE. \n\nThe hair presented as human and DNA analysis subsequently determined the hair was human.  The hair was co-mingled with prescription glasses, identifiable as \"Fossil\" brand, model Mitchell ODR5 140.  Additional items included multicolor hair elastics and shark tooth necklace with word REP DOM on back.  \n\nDNA analysis yielded a full, single-source mitochondrial profile, which does not currently match any other known missing persons case.","case_hair_color":"Brown","case_head_hair":"","case_body_hair":"Unknown","case_facial_hair":"Unknown","case_eye_color_left":"Unknown or Missing","case_eye_color_right":"Unknown or Missing","case_eye_description":"Decomposition (hair only) precluded assessment of eye color.","fingerprints":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tFingerprint information is currently not available\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t","clothing_accessories":"","case_clothing_on_body":"","case_clothing_with_body":"","case_footwear":"","case_jewelry":"1. A multi-colored (yellow, orange, brown, green) crocheted yarn bracelet with brown loops on either end.\n\n2. A light brown and dark brown twine macramÃ© or knot-stitched necklace with an apparent sharkâ€™s tooth pendant with an etched inscription of â€œREP.DOM.â€  The sharkâ€™s tooth is approximately 3 cm wide and 5 cm high.\n\n3. A dirtied white shoelace with clumps of hair entangled within.\n\n4. A mottled brown-and orange piece of string or narrow bore twine with an approximate diameter of 1 mm.\n\n5. What appears to be a five strand strip of 3 neon red and 2 neon blue cording with an approximate diameter of 1.5 to 2 mm for each cord.  \n\n6. A blue puka-type bracelet containing alternating tan to white seashells, white puka shells  and light tan and dark tan brown beads.  There is no obvious closure mechanism, therefore it is thought that the shells and beads are strung on elastic cording.  The puka shells appear to be approximately 3 mm in diameter and the tan and white seashells appear to be approximately 6 mm wide by 8 mm high. \n\n7. A pair of Fossil Mitchell Black Semi Matte (0DR5) Eyeglasses which have a matte black frame with black and yellow divided colors on both distal ends of the temple â€œarmsâ€. On the left temple is â€œMitchell 0DR5 140â€ inscribed and on the on the right temple â€œ140â„¢ FOSSIL Â® Å’â€ is inscribed. On the distal ends of both left and right temples â€œFOSSILâ€ is inscribed. The nose pads and pad arms are bent in an anterior lateral direction pressing up against their respective lenses. Both wire rims (left and right) are 6 cm in length to 2.5 cm in height to approximately 3 mm in depth. The right lens has previous abuse, and the left lens is absent from the frame. The prescription of the lens is 0.25-1X117 and is distant vision only.  The lens is also transitional (gets darker with light).\n\n8. A black cloth covered bracelet with what looks like a red stretch cord interior that has an approximate diameter of 4 mm. \n\n9. A mottled brown-and orange piece of string or narrow bore twine with an approximate diameter of 1 mm.\n","case_eyewear":"Fossil Mitchell Black Semi Matte (0DR5) Eyeglasses\n","case_other_items_with_body":"","dental":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tDental information / charting is currently not available\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t","dna":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSample submitted - Tests complete\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t","images":["/en/medias/thumb/10503","/en/medias/thumb/10504","/en/medias/thumb/10505","/en/medias/thumb/10506","/en/medias/thumb/10507","/en/medias/thumb/10508","/en/medias/thumb/10509","/en/medias/thumb/10510","/en/medias/thumb/10547"],"documents":"\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThere are currently no documents available for this case.<br><br><br><br>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t"}
