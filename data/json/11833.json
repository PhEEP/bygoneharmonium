Stone Memorial St. Joseph Peninsula State Park in Port St. Joe, Florida to collect seashells.  The woman was walking on the Gulf of Mexico side of the beach and discovered a mandible in the sand she thought to be an “Indian skull artifact”.  The woman held onto the mandible for many years until August of 1998 when she mailed the mandible to her niece that lived in Greenfield, Wisconsin.  Once the niece received the mandible in the mail she took it to the Greenfield Police Department who brought the mandible to the Milwaukee County Medical Examiner’s Office (MCMEO) for analysis in 1998.  The mandible was determined to be human and will be sent for DNA and anthropological analysis at the University of North Texas – Center for Human Identification.\n\nThe City of Port Saint Joe Police Department and the District 14 Florida Medical Examiner’s Office have been contacted and notified about this case.  The District 14 Florida Medical Examiner’s Office agreed with the MCMEO proceeding with a DNA and anthropological analysis of the mandible at University of North Texas – Center for Human Identification.
