The child is estimated to be 1-3 years old with light brown to blonde, wavy hair. She had a large gap in between her two top middle teeth that would have been noticeable to others. The child was found with another Caucasian girl, 2-4 years old (NamUs #2175). Itâ€™s estimated that both children died at the same time between 1978-1984. DNA has confirmed that this 1-3 year old child is maternally related to two additional females that remain unidentified, an adult and child, recovered earlier in 1985 in the same wooded area of Allenstown (NamUs #2174 and 2173). Advanced forensic testing has suggested that the three related victims were possibly born and raised together in New Hampshire or one of the surrounding states.
