She was located approx. 20 ft. off of the roadway in the weeds. She was stuffed inside a large heavy-duty black plastic bag. She was in a fetal position inside the bag. She was in an advanced state of decomposition but so much that it was evident that she had no marks or tattoos on her body. There was a scar on her lower abdomen that was from a hysterectomy operation. It is believed that she had been dumped at this location within 7-8 days prior to her discovery. This location is approx. Â¼- Â½ mile from the PA Turnpike, Exit 22 (Morgantown exchange). The autopsy results are available to law enforcement agencies upon request. The toxicology results indicated that she did NOT have drugs or alcohol in her system. Both thumbprints from the victim were also obtained.\n","case_hair_color":"Black","case_head_hair":"Scalp hair is black, tight curly and about 1 inch long","case_body_hair":"","case_facial_hair":"","case_eye_color_left":"","case_eye_color_right":"","case_eye_description":"","case_scars_and_marks_details":"checked","case_piercings_details":"checked","fingerprints":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tFingerprint information is available elsewhere\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t","clothing_accessories":"","case_clothing_on_body":"Purple cotton gym shorts (large) \nBlack bra (size 36-C) \nZebra striped panties \nMulticolored bandanna on her head that was mostly black \nBust size: 36-C\n \n","case_clothing_with_body":"","case_footwear":"","case_jewelry":"Pair of small gold colored hoop earrings (costume jewelry)","case_eyewear":"","case_other_items_with_body":"","dental":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tDental information / charting is available and entered\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t","dna":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSample submitted - Tests complete\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t","images":["/en/medias/thumb/827","/en/medias/thumb/828","/en/medias/thumb/829"],"documents":"\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThere are currently no documents available for this case.<br><br><br><br>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t"}
