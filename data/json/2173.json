The child is estimated to be 5-11 years old with light brown to blonde wavy hair. The child was found with an adult female, estimated to be 22-33 years old, who also remains unidentified (NamUs #2174). Itâ€™s estimated that both of these females died at the same time between 1978-1984. DNA has confirmed that both females are maternally related to each other, in addition to another unidentified child, a Caucasian girl 1-3 years old that was discovered on May 9, 2000 in the same wooded area of Allenstown in a second barrel (NamUs #2176). This third related child was also found with another Caucasian girl, 2-4 years old that remains unidentified (NamUs #2175), and it is unclear how she may be related to the other three victims. Advanced forensic testing suggest that the three related victims were possibly born and raised together in New Hampshire or one of the surrounding states.
