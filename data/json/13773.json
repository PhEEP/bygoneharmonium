Both victims were shot multiple times.\n\nThe only potential identifiers found at the scene was a ring worn by the male that had the initials “JPF” inscribed. The ring was described as being of a Far Eastern design.\n\nOver the years, the fingerprints of both subjects have been periodically resubmitted to the FBI database to see if any new information may have been entered somewhere that may help solve their identities. In 2007, the bodies were exhumed by a team of our forensic investigators, then Coroner Verna Moore, agents from the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division (SLED) and forensic pathologists from Newberry Pathology to get samples to be submitted into the state, national and international DNA databases.","case_hair_color":"Brown","case_head_hair":"reddish-brown, shoulder-length hair","case_body_hair":"","case_facial_hair":"","case_eye_color_left":"Hazel","case_eye_color_right":"Hazel","case_eye_description":"","case_scars_and_marks_details":"checked","fingerprints":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tFingerprint information is available elsewhere\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t","clothing_accessories":"","case_clothing_on_body":"unbleached white muslin blouse over a pink, front-tying halter top, and blue cutoff denim shorts with a floral print scarf tied around her waist as a belt","case_clothing_with_body":"","case_footwear":"lavender and pink Stride-Rite brand wedge-heeled sandals ","case_jewelry":"three silver rings, see IMAGES tab","case_eyewear":"","case_other_items_with_body":"","dental":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tDental information / charting is available and will be entered later\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t","dna":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSample submitted - Tests complete\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t","images":["/en/medias/thumb/29633","/en/medias/thumb/29636","/en/medias/thumb/29637","/en/medias/thumb/29638"],"documents":"\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThere are currently no documents available for this case.<br><br><br><br>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t"}
