The hikers took the bones and returned home in Florida. The hikers reportedly saw an episode of America's Most Wanted and thought the bones might have something to do with a case of a 16 year old boy in which all but a leg bone had been recovered. The bones were taken to the Pinellas Co. Sheriff's Office in Florida and were given to their Medical Examiner's office, who in turn notified and returned the bones to our office.","case_hair_color":"Unknown or Completely Bald","case_head_hair":"","case_body_hair":"","case_facial_hair":"","case_eye_color_left":"Unknown or Missing","case_eye_color_right":"Unknown or Missing","case_eye_description":"","fingerprints":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tFingerprint information is currently not available\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t","clothing_accessories":"","case_clothing_on_body":"","case_clothing_with_body":"","case_footwear":"","case_jewelry":"","case_eyewear":"","case_other_items_with_body":"","dental":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tDental information / charting is currently not available\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t","dna":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSample is currently not available\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t","images":[],"documents":"\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThere are currently no documents available for this case.<br><br><br><br>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t"}
